	<h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Dan Wells and I recently retired as a Commander in the US Navy.  I am pursuing a second career as a Web/Software developer.  My educational background is in Computer Science and my personal interest in programming has always been strong.  Recently, I took the opportunity to brush up on the latest Web Development technologies as a student in the inaugural class of Omaha Code School.  I have also been working on my first iPhone app for a business in Colorado that creates and publishes guidebooks for off-road trails.  My next goal is to find a job where I can use my programming skills on a daily basis and help create quality products. </p>
